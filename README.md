# The Tensor Train (TT) Density algorithm is a method for estimating multivariate densities.

# In main.py, we use a Beta mixture model as an example to demonstrate the performance of TT. 

# We use TT for conditional sampling and evaluate the resulting conditional samples using the sliced Wasserstein distance. We compare TT’s performance against the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) sampler .
